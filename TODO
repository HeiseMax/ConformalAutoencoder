Move augmentation to Autoencoder? Make wrapper function
test trace loss with unnormalized vectors


General Hyperparameters, losses, reg, etc as parameters for AE:
num_samples for trace estimate (conform/regularization)



Use Riemannina metric (J(z)^TJ(z)) to get geodesics -> interpolation.


Is there a way to improve the estimate of c by using off diagonal elements? (https://chatgpt.com/share/6894cae7-29a4-800a-81d5-c18454d53609)
